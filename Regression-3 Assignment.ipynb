    "Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression objective function. This penalty term, also known as L2 regularization, is proportional to the sum of the squared values of the coefficients. The addition of this penalty term helps to regularize the regression coefficients and mitigate overfitting in situations where multicollinearity exists among the predictor variables.\n",

    "Objective Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression minimizes the residual sum of squares (RSS) between the observed and predicted values.\n",
    "Ridge Regression minimizes the sum of the RSS and a penalty term, which is proportional to the sum of the squared values of the regression coefficients.\n",
    "Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS Regression does not include any penalty term, and it estimates the coefficients that minimize the sum of squared residuals only.\n",
    "Ridge Regression includes a penalty term to the loss function, which penalizes large coefficients. This penalty term helps to shrink the coefficients towards zero, effectively reducing their magnitudes.\n",
    "Bias-Variance Trade-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS Regression may suffer from overfitting when the number of predictor variables is large relative to the number of observations, or when multicollinearity is present among predictors.\n",

    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS Regression does not perform feature selection. It estimates coefficients for all predictor variables in the model.\n",

    "Ridge Regression shares many of the assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, as it is an extension of linear regression. However, there are some additional assumptions specific to Ridge Regression due to the introduction of regularization. Here are the key assumptions of Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: Ridge Regression assumes that the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable is linear. This means that the effect of a one-unit change in the predictor variable is constant across all levels of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Errors: Similar to OLS regression, Ridge Regression assumes that the errors (residuals) are independent of each other. In other words, the error terms for different observations are not correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: Ridge Regression assumes that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the predictor variables. This means that the spread of the residuals is consistent throughout the range of the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of Errors: Ridge Regression does not explicitly require the normality of the errors, but it assumes that the errors follow a symmetric distribution around zero. This assumption is necessary for the estimation of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Perfect Multicollinearity: Ridge Regression assumes that there is no perfect multicollinearity among the predictor variables. Perfect multicollinearity occurs when one predictor variable is a perfect linear combination of other predictor variables, making it impossible to estimate the coefficients uniquely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Assumption for Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression assumes that the penalty parameter (lambda or alpha) is chosen appropriately to balance the trade-off between bias and variance. Selecting an optimal value for the penalty parameter is crucial for the effectiveness of Ridge Regression in preventing overfitting."
