Each subset serves a specific purpose and has its own importance. Here's an explanation of each term and its significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Set: The training set is the portion of the dataset used to train the machine learning model. It contains input data along with corresponding target labels or outputs. During training, the model learns from this labeled data and adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and true labels. The larger the training set, the better the model can capture the underlying patterns and generalize to unseen data.\n",

This evaluation provides an estimate of how well the model is expected to perform on new, unseen data.\n",
