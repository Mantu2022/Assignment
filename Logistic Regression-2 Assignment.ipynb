    "Data leakage, also known as information leakage or target leakage, occurs when information from outside the training dataset is inadvertently included in the model training process, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates and misleading results. Data leakage can significantly compromise the integrity and generalizability of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage is a problem in machine learning because it can lead to models that perform well on the training data but poorly on unseen data, as the model may inadvertently learn relationships that do not exist in the real-world data. This can result in overfitting, where the model learns patterns specific to the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",

You have a dataset containing information about transactions, including features such as transaction amount, merchant ID, and time of transaction, as well as a binary target variable indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.\n",

    "Now, imagine that you mistakenly include the transaction timestamp (time of transaction) as a feature in your model. Upon closer inspection, you realize that fraudulent transactions tend to occur more frequently during certain times of the day or week, such as late at night or on weekends. As a result, the model may learn to associate certain timestamps with fraudulent transactions, effectively \"leaking\" information from the target variable into the features.\n",

    "In this scenario, the model may perform well during training and validation because it has inadvertently learned to exploit the relationship between the timestamp and the target variable. However, when deployed in the real world, the model is likely to perform poorly because the relationship between the timestamp and fraud is not causal but rather coincidental.\n",
