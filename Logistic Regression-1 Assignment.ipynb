    "Regularization in logistic regression is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to fit the training data too closely, capturing noise and irrelevant patterns in the data, which reduces its ability to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "There are two common types of regularization used in logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression):\n",
    "\n",
    "In L1 regularization, a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients is added to the cost function.\n",

    "L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression):\n",
    "\n",
    "In L2 regularization, a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients is added to the cost function.\n",
    "L2 regularization penalizes large coefficients, encouraging them to be smaller and smoother.\n",
    "The regularization parameter \n",
    "λ controls the strength of regularization applied to the model. A higher value of \n",
    "λ results in stronger regularization, which can help prevent overfitting but may lead to underfitting if set too high.\n",
    "Regularization helps prevent overfitting in logistic regression by discouraging overly complex models with high coefficients. It achieves this by finding a balance between fitting the training data well and keeping the model parameters small, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Regularization also aids in reducing the variance of the model, making it more robust and less sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data. Overall, regularization is a valuable tool in logistic regression for building models that generalize well to new data while avoiding overfitting."
