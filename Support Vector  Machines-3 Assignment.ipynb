    "In the context of developing an SVM regression model to predict house prices based on various characteristics, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., the most appropriate regression metric to employ would be the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric calculates the average absolute differences between the predicted prices and the actual prices. MAE provides a straightforward interpretation of the average prediction error in the same unit as the target variable (e.g., dollars in the case of house prices). It is less sensitive to outliers compared to RMSE.\n",
