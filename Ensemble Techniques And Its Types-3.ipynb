    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms inherent to its design:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Random Forest Regressor employs an ensemble learning technique called bagging, where multiple decision trees are trained on different subsets of the training data. Each tree is trained independently on a bootstrapped sample of the original dataset, which involves random sampling with replacement. By training multiple trees on different subsets of the data, Random Forest Regressor reduces the variance of the model, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Feature Selection: At each node of the decision tree, Random Forest Regressor selects a random subset of features to consider for splitting. This random feature selection helps to decorrelate the trees in the ensemble and ensures that no single feature dominates the decision-making process across all trees. As a result, the model becomes less sensitive to noise and outliers in the training data, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Averaging: In Random Forest Regressor, predictions are made by averaging the predictions of all the individual decision trees in the ensemble. Ensemble averaging helps to smooth out the predictions and reduces the influence of individual noisy or biased trees. By combining the predictions of multiple trees, the model generalizes better to unseen data and is less likely to overfit to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the combination of bagging, random feature selection, and ensemble averaging in Random Forest Regressor helps to create a more robust and generalizable model that is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees."

    "Independently trained decision trees: In a Random Forest Regressor, multiple decision trees are trained independently on different subsets of the training data. Each tree is constructed using a random subset of features and a bootstrapped sample (random sampling with replacement) of the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction from each tree: Once the decision trees are trained, they can make predictions on new data points. Each tree predicts a continuous numerical output (regression) based on the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation of predictions: The predictions of all the individual decision trees are aggregated to obtain the final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor. This aggregation is typically done by taking the mean (average) of the predictions from all the trees. In some cases, other aggregation methods such as median or weighted averaging may be used.\n",
